    <h3>Multi-Channel Marketing</h3>
    <p>Multi-channel marketing has come a long way since operating disparate activities in silos. Along a user journey, a customer
      can encounter various messages related to your brand that all contribute to a conversion. If you understand the contribution
      each channel makes, you can reduce costs and improve conversions.</p>

    <h3>Omni-Channel Marketing</h3>
    <p>Yep, I get it! Customers engage with brands on their laptops, mobile devices, they call companies, message them and pop
      in to see them. They are omni-channel kings. Look at them, engaging with brands by day and night, on trains and buses,
      in the living room and even in bed. Whereas companies have been somewhat slower to respond. Often blocked by technical
      capabilities, skills and resource issues.</p>
    <h4>MY SERVICES INCLUDE...</h4>

    <h3>Conversion Rate Optimisation</h3>
    <p>What on earth is CRO? Put simply, it's improving any metric on your website that is important to your business. Often
      that can be:</p>
    <p>Converting more browsers into buyers</p>
    <p>Increasing the conversion frequency of repeat customers</p>
    <p>Increasing the number of registrations, downloads, newsletter signups.</p>
    <p>CRO is not about unqualified hunches or guesses. It's most certainly not driven by the most senior's person's opinion
      and it is not about getting as many users as possible, regardless of quality or engagement.</p>
    <p>I identify the barriers in your website conversion funnel using data and looks to improve conversion using small, incremental
      experiments.</p>

    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>I take a data-driven approach and develop growth strategies with data at its core. I turn data into actionable metrics
      that grow sales and improve the return on investment.</p>
    <p>I aim to ensure as many touch points capture data for continued insight and segmentation. Whether that be using off the
      shelf analytics packages, gaining insight from data warehouses or presenting clear, transparent results on a tableau
      spreadsheet.</p>

    <h3>An agile aproach</h3>
    <p>In a moments notice, a customer, market or competitor landscape can change, forcing you to adapt.
      <p>
        <p>Gain scale and yet remain agile.
          <p>
            <p>Plan and yet adapt at a moment's notice.

                <p>Minimise waste
                  <p>
                    <h3>Why lean crow?</h3>
                    <p>I believe big ambitions should be broken into manageable chunks. That a marketing strategy should build
                      over time using many small, measurable experiments over a few large bets. Because I don't like heavily
                      investing in something if there's little to suggest it will work. Because I want to reduce waste.
                      <p>
                        <p>I like lean thinking and I like working smartly.
                          <p>
