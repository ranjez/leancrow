    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <p>Yep, I get it! Customers engage with brands on their laptops, mobile devices, they call companies, message them and pop
      in to see them. They are omni-channel kings. Look at them, engaging with brands by day and night, on trains and buses,
      in the living room and even in bed. Whereas companies have been somewhat slower to respond. Often blocked by technical
      capabilities, skills and resource issues.</p>

    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>I take a data-driven approach and develop growth strategies with data at its core. I turn data into actionable metrics
      that grow sales and improve the return on investment.</p>
    <p>I aim to ensure as many touch points capture data for continued insight and segmentation. Whether that be using off the
      shelf analytics packages, gaining insight from data warehouses or presenting clear, transparent results on a tableau
      spreadsheet.</p>

    <p>In a moments notice, a customer, market or competitor landscape can change, forcing you to adapt.
      <p>
        <p>Gain scale and yet remain agile.
          <p>
            <p>Plan and yet adapt at a moment's notice.
              <p>
                <p>Minimise waste
                  <p>
                    <h3>Why lean crow?</h3>
                    <p>I believe big ambitions should be broken into manageable chunks. That a marketing strategy should build
                      over time using many small, measurable experiments over a few large bets. Because I don't like heavily
                      investing in something if there's little to suggest it will work. Because I want to reduce waste.
                      <p>
                        <p>I like lean thinking and I like working smartly.
