        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>I take a data-driven approach and develop growth strategies with data at its core. I turn data into actionable metrics that grow sales and improve the return on investment.</p>
        <p>I aim to ensure as many touch points capture data for continued insight and segmentation. Whether that be using off the shelf analytics packages, gaining insight from data warehouses or presenting clear, transparent results on a tableau spreadsheet.

        <h3>Me</h3>
        <p>I'm Kerry Abass and I am passionate about marketing digital products and services that both delight customers and deliver a significant commercial impact. I have worked in international roles, both at the office and from remote locations, collaborating with colleagues, partners and agencies to deliver products that solve customer problems.  </p>
        
        <h3>Why lean crow?</h3>
        <p>I believe big ambitions should be broken into manageable chunks. That a marketing strategy should build over time using many small, measurable experiments over a few large bets. Because I don't like heavily investing in something if there's little to suggest it will work. Because I want to reduce waste.</p>
         <p>I like lean thinking and I like working smartly.</p>
